      remember the really old Zork choose-your-own-adventure books? In the first one, one of the
      false paths (just to see if you were cheating) went something like, &quot;If you got the
      magic sneakers from the Prince of Kaldorn, turn to page 39.&quot; In the second book, the
      Prince actually turned up and gave you a set of magic sneakers. I was very pleased when I
      bought LToI I, finally played Enchanter and ran into the Prince of Kaldorn again (well,
      sort of). (He also turns up in the Invisiclues for that game, although he's using magic
      pajamas this time.)<br>
