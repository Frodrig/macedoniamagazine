<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> Can you tell us how did you get involved in interactive entertainment?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> I had loved computer games for many years, ever since I had
played the original Colossal Caves and the early <em>Star Trek</em> game on a mainframe
(this was before computers had monitors; we typed our input on a terminal, and then the
computer's responses were printed out in hard copy).</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">During the early 80's, I was a <em>console</em> gamer, and played
mostly Colecovision games. In the mid-80's, I started to earn my gaming money by reviewing
games for a magazine called <em>Videogames And Computer Entertainment</em>. I didn't buy
my first computer until 1986, and I immediately began writing game reviews for the
magazine and for CompuServe's online gaming magazine. (I didn't get paid for those
reviews, but I got all the free games I could play!). Online, I met a fellow named Guruka
Singh Khalsa, and he had read some of my reviews and walkthrus. When I found out that
Guruka was the Producer at Sierra On-Line, I asked if he would allow me to be a
beta-tester, and he said yes. I also beta-tested for Infocom at that time.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">Beta-testing for Sierra was a great experience. I remember trying
to track down a particularly elusive bug in Codename: Iceman, in which I was on the
telephone with Mark Hood for at least a couple of hours while we figured out where the
problem was. I would prepare very detailed beta reports and was, I think, a good tester
for them.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">So eventually, in a year or two, Guruka called one day to ask
whether or not I'd be interested in working for Sierra on-site as his Assistant Producer,
because the number of titles, and their scale, was getting too large for one Producer to
handle. I was working in advertising at that time, and never thought I would take the job.
But after visiting Sierra, meeting the people there (especially Guruka, Bill Davis, and
Ken Williams), and seeing how beautiful Oakhurst was, I decided to take the job.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">For the first 8 months, I was the Assistant Producer there, but I
was able to move quickly to the Product Design department and begun writing and designing.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> You gave your voice to a number of characters on early CDROM games from
Sierra, including Graham in <em>King's Quest V</em>. Your performance was one of the bests
in that game; did you have any prior experience with voice acting?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> Thank you! I did have quite a bit of prior experience in
voice acting before going to Sierra. I had been in a movie, on several television
programs, and did voices for radio programs and commercials. My major in college was
Acting and I had worked as a stand-up comedian for many years before going into
advertising.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">I was not very happy with my performance in King's Quest V. It
was the first time Roberta had directed (although she had Mark Seibert to help her) and
she wanted King Graham to always be &quot;buff&quot; and brave. There were many times in
the recording where I would try to do some real acting, and give Graham moods and
emotions, but Roberta kept saying, &quot;He's never tired, he's King Graham!&quot; or
&quot;He's never worried, he's King Graham!&quot;. So I felt the performance did not have
enough emotion in it, but people seemed to like it anyway, so maybe Roberta was on to
something.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> At that time, Sierra designers used to include several design tricks in
games, like multiples ways of dying and dead ends. For instance, many people thinks that
the dead-ends in the final chase of <em>Laura Bow in The Dagger of Amon Ra</em> are
totally unfair. What was the designer intention with those dead ends?</p>

<p><img src="gif/entjom-2.gif" width="240" height="154" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2"
alt="Laura Bow taking over New York"><font color="#400080"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> I don't want to speak for
Bruce Balfour (the designer of Laura Bow 2), but I believe that he was trying to create a
sense of great threat to Laura in that final act. In the earlier acts, Laura herself was
never in jeopardy; it was always somebody else. (I think it was the same way in Laura Bow
1, <em>The Colonel's Bequest</em>.) And Laura Bow 2 was designed before it became out of
fashion to have the main character die. After all, Roger Wilco died all kinds of gruesome
deaths in the Space Quest series, and the fans seemed to love that.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">The funny thing is that the last act of Roberta's game <em>Phantasmagoria</em>
is exactly the same as the last act of Laura Bow 2; they both consist of a sudden
&quot;chase scene&quot; with many, many dead ends and horrible deaths for the main
character. And Phantasmagoria was designed years after Laura Bow 2. So I have to think
that Roberta really liked the way Bruce designed the end of Laura Bow 2.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> Back to Dagger of Amon Ra, other criticism is that there are not enough
clues to really find out the answer to all the questions you are faced at the end of the
game. Are we players too dumb, or was the game a bit too hard?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> I think there were two problems there. One was that the
player was not warned ahead of time that it was best to take notes. So most players got to
the questions at the end of the game and said, &quot;WHAT? I don't remember all of
this!&quot; and resented the fact that they had not been told earlier to make notes.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">The other problem was that Bruce, like most of us, were trying to
design games where there were more details than people might find the first time through
the game. We wanted to increase playability, so we put in so much detail that people might
need to play two or three times to find all the details. If the player could not answer
some questions at the end, it was probably not because the player was dumb NOR because the
game was too hard, but because there were so many details, a player was liable to miss
some of them during the course of the game. And people like to play quickly, getting from
one puzzle to the next as quickly as possible, so they would be even more likely to miss
some details.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> You worked with Al Lowe in <em>Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist</em>. How
it was working with such a famous designer? What were your contributions to the game?</p>

<p><img src="gif/entjom-3.gif" width="124" height="180" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2"
alt="Freddy Pharkas becoming an earless boy"><font color="#400080"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> It was great to
work with Al. He let me do all sorts of things that he didn't necessarily want to do, and
fortunately they turned out well. He designed most of the puzzles, but I took a few out
(there were too many puzzles dealing with &quot;bathroom humor&quot;) and added quite a
few others. For instance, his design only had three acts; I added a fourth act. I wrote
the ballads at the beginning and the end, the scene in the basement of the school with the
fire, the character of Srini, and the part where Freddy gets his good ear shot off. In
fact, I wrote virtually all of the narration and dialogue and most of the jokes in the
game; Al's design did not include more than a handful of sample jokes. He was working on <em>Leisure
Suit Larry 6</em> most of the time.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> Freddy is a rather linear game. To all the people out there claiming that
good adventures should be non-linear, please can you tell what you acomplished with the
linearity of that game?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> I think they're wrong. An adventure game, traditionally,
tells a story. Well, stories are, and always have been, linear, and the invention of the
computer has not changed storytelling. Good stories have a beginning, a middle, and an
end, and are carefully constructed and paced so as to create dramatic tension, comic
relief, excitement, and other emotions. You can't be sloppy or the story will not be very
involving. Storytelling is not easy, and most people don't know how to tell stories well.
Some people seem to be born storytellers, others must be trained.</font></p>

<p align="center"><img src="gif/entjom-4.gif" width="240" height="154" hspace="4" vspace="2"
alt="Freddy Pharkas at the saloon"></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">In &quot;non-linear&quot; games, the player becomes the
storyteller. Well, if the player is the storyteller, and if the player is not a VERY GOOD
storyteller, then the player will not tell the story very well! You'll end up with a long,
rambling game that does not build dramatic tension.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">People say they want non-linear games, but that's not what they
really want. When players are given non-linear adventures, they complain: &quot;I didn't
know what my goal was,&quot; &quot;I didn't know where to go first or what to do.&quot;
They really want direction. But they want it to be DISGUISED, so that they don't feel like
it's OBVIOUS that they're being led around by the nose.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> There was quite some trouble with <em>Space Quest 6: The Spinal Frontier</em>.
The early desing was done by you, but then you left Sierra in the midst of the production.
Was the final game very different from your early plans?</p>

<p><img src="gif/entjom-5.gif" width="240" height="154" align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2"
alt="Roger Wilco at Space Quest 6">J<font color="#400080">osh: The game was, in many ways,
close to the original design. Scott did not change very much. He did change the closing,
which I thought was not very dramatic, and he did not put in much text or dialogue. As a
result, you can see the differences very clearly between the rooms I worked on and the
rooms Scott worked on. The rooms I worked on had dozens and dozens of things you could
click on and get a response. The rooms he worked on had very few responses. There were
some puzzles implemented incorrectly because Scott either did not like, or did not
understand, some of what I had designed. But the overall plot and movement of the story
were very close to what I originally envisioned.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> What facets of the previous Space Quest chapters you wanted to avoid /
retain in the sixth episode?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> One of the problems, I thought, with some of the earlier
Space Quests was that the plots were not well-defined. Most of the time you just kind of
rambled from situation to situation, and from planet to planet, without a clear idea of
what your overall goal was, where you wanted to end up at the end of the game. I wanted to
avoid that. I always wanted to avoid the fact that other Space Quests did not have a
theme. By this, I mean a statement or attitude about humanity that becomes the
&quot;point&quot; of the story, such as, &quot;Life is about doing things for other
people, not for yourself&quot; or &quot;Man's greatest inhumanity is to himself.&quot; I
did not think it would hurt Space Quest to have a theme. After all, computer games have
the power to influence people's moods and actions.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">So I gave SQ6 the simple theme of &quot;One cannot hope to make
it through this world without friends.&quot; Roger never seemed, in other SQs, to have any
real friends. So I wanted him to have Stellar Santiago as a friend (not as a love
interest, he already had that with Beatrice), and for him to learn to value that
friendship. I don't think that came through very well in the final game, because I don't
think Scott understood that that's what I was designing.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">What I really liked about the other SQs was the way they managed
to satirize and parody so many other science-fiction games, TV shows, movies, and books. I
think we did that better in SQ6 than in any of the other SQs. There are areas in SQ6 where
nearly every single response is a joke, pun, or hidden reference to science fiction. I
love that kind of thing!</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> Later you joined Legend Entertainment. How did you like the change?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> It was a very difficult transition. At Legend, every single
employee (except for the secretaries) was a programmer. So when I started designing, I was
designing like I'd been doing at Sierra, and they weren't prepared to process that kind of
design. They wanted me to design in &quot;pseudocode,&quot; or in a kind of fake
programming language, and I know very little about programming. We had to adjust to each
other's expectations.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">Also, the budgets at Legend were very small, and because the
money was always coming from an outside investor, the budget would change during the
course of the game's development. Things would go wrong and there wouldn't always be the
money to fix them. Both Mike Verdu and I ended up paying for some things out of our own
pockets so that they would be fixed.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">Lastly, Legend was very, very small. I was employee #13. There
were no artists on staff (we hired outside art companies), no composers. At Sierra, if you
wanted to try something, you just found an artist who had a little free time, and they
would help you. At Legend, you had to request it, and the request had to go to the art
company, and they would charge you for it...it definitely hindered experimentation.</font></p>

<p><img src="gif/entjom-6.gif" width="240" height="154" alt="Callahan's Crosstime Saloon"
align="right" hspace="4" vspace="2"><p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> At Legend, you designed the game <em>Callahan's
Crosstime Saloon</em>. It is a shame that most Legend games are not usually published here
in Spain, no matter how good they are or how much awards they have won. This game is based
upon some short stories from author Spider Robinson. How does it feel writing a game based
on other people's creations?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> It was not that different from many experiences at Sierra.
After all, I worked on Space Quest (the creation of Mark Crowe and Scott Murphy), King's
Quest and Laura Bow (Roberta's creations), and Leisure Suit Larry (Al's creation). Only
Freddy Pharkas felt like it was partially my own creation.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">Legend had given me a choice of writers to adapt, and I chose
Spider Robinson because I loved and respected the Callahan's stories. Unlike Space Quest
or King Quest or Leisure Suit Larry, Spider's stories had a very strong theme, and his
characters were much more complex and &quot;real&quot; than someone like Roger or Larry,
who are pretty much cartoon characters. Spider himself was wonderfully easy to work with;
he knew that I respected the integrity of the books and would not have his characters
doing things in the game that they would never do in the books. So he trusted me to do
with them as I wanted. He only changed one thing: I had come up with an &quot;origin&quot;
story for one of the characters, but Spider was already working on a book of origin
stories (including one for that same character). So, at his request, I dropped the origin
story and came up with something else.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">What was especially gratifying was playing the game for Spider
when it was finished. He sat with his mouth open, staring in amazement, and kept saying,
&quot;That's it! That's Callahan's Place!&quot; That helped make it all worthwhile. And
the fans of Callahan's had the same reaction. I felt very satisfied, if I could adapt the
book into computer game form and NOT have people yelling at me that I'd ruined the books.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> As an exception, Legend's <em>Blackstone Chronicles</em> has been released
in Spain. What do you think of this game? Can we expect new adventure games from Legend?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> I really enjoyed <em>Blackstone Chronicles</em>; the voice
acting and the atmosphere were some of the best I've ever experienced in a computer game.
Unfortunately, Legend has no more adventure games planned. They have been purchased by GT
Interactive, and are now working on first-person or third-person &quot;shooters&quot;
(maybe with some RPG elements). Specifically, they have <em>Wheel of Time</em> coming up,
and the sequel to <em>Unreal</em> and an <em>Unreal</em> add-on. Not the kind of thing you
usually associate with Legend!</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> Your games tend to be very heavy on text, with tons of large descriptions
filled with puns (that was the impression I got from Laura Bow II, Freddy Pharkas and
Space Quest 6, and I believe that Callahan goes in the same direction). You do it that way
to rettain the flavor of old Infocom text adventures, to mislead the players, as a funny
way of hiding hints, just because you love writting,...?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> Well, yes, I love to write, but that's not really why I
write such text-heavy games. Part of it is that I do love the Infocom adventures and I
like the atmosphere I got from them. Part of it is that I love wordplay and jokes, and you
can't do those in graphics (well, you can do &quot;sight gags&quot; with graphics, but
graphics tend to be very expensive, so it's cheaper to write text jokes than to write
visual jokes and then animate them). And part of it is that I don't like to rely just on
the graphics to communicate all the little, funny details about the people and objects in
the environments. The only way to flesh them out, since players don't have the benefit of
touch, taste, and smell, is to describe them. Lastly, I don't do it to mislead players,
but I do love to hide hints in the text.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">That's one of the things that I think has almost vanished from
adventure games: HINTS. I don't mean a hint system, I mean providing enough information to
the player for them to solve puzzles without trial-and-error. Nowadays, you just click on
everything until you find something that works. I would rather encourage people to read
and observe and then THINK about what they've read and observed, and solve the puzzles
that way. The trouble is, games like MYST have given people a different expectation, so
they are no longer patient enough to go through the puzzle-solving process in a thoughtful
way. They just want to get to the next pretty screen.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> When you sit down to create an adventure game, what are your main goals? How

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> My main goal is always to entertain. Some designers are so
caught up in creating their own vision that they forget that games are a form of
entertainment. You can't make people laugh or cry, or educate them, if you don't entertain
them. If you don't entertain them, they will turn off the computer before you can get
around to touching them on a deeper level.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">The other goals change depending on the type of game I'm supposed
to design. I try not to think about the perfect adventure. It makes my head hurt.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> Not in the traditional sense. I am involved with the
development of games at Sega that have some adventure game elements, but they have too
many action game elements for me to think of them as adventure games. The market in the
United States for adventure games has been extremely poor lately. so it's very difficult
to get a publisher to agree to do an adventure.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> Sierra has been very controversial for the last years. Sierra grew and grew

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> Yes, Sierra went wrong when it became a &quot;public
company,&quot; and started attracting outside investors. These outside investors cared
more about the kind of huge growth you're talking about, and did not care about the
content or quality of the games (except as they affected profits). Suddenly, people who
knew nothing about games, and didn't WANT to know anything about games, were controlling
the company's policies. Greed took over. I would've hoped that Sierra would be willing to
stay small in exchange for retaining control over its content and quality. But Ken has
always looked up to Bill Gates, and I think he wanted to create a huge empire.</font></p>

what do you think is the best policy: holding on until the game is perfect [even going
overbudget], or releasing games wich a few flaws?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> I think the hard part is judging the &quot;point of
diminishing returns,&quot; where you decide that the game is not perfect (no game ever is;
they're too complicated), but it's close ENOUGH. At that point, you want to stop putting
money into the game because the differences that additional money will make are too small
to be noticed.</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">I think both companies have released some near-perfect games and
some too-buggy games, and Sierra has released more of those than LucasArts. I'll say this
in Sierra's defense, though: adventure games were what paid the bills at Sierra, and
Sierra had to release enough of them, quickly enough, to keep the company going. LucasArts
releases very few adventure games, not nearly enough to support the company. When you only
release an adventure game every year or two, you can afford to take your time. Sierra did
not have the luxury of perfection; they did not have the deep pockets of a George Lucas
supporting them. Very few LucasArts adventure games were profitable; maybe they took too
long polishing them.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> Is the destiny of any succesful, growing adventure game company to stop
supporting adventure games in order to create other types of games more commercial and
easier to produce?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> At the moment, this appears to be true. Legend, Sierra,
LucasArts, Access...all of them have stopped producing adventure games because there is
very little profit in that genre right now. But I think it would be wrong to say that
that's the way it will always be.</font></p>

<p align="justify"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#008000"><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B>M.M.-</B></FONT><font size=2 face=arial color="#000000"> With commercial adventure games selling poorly, how do you view the future
of adventure gaming? Would it be possible that those companys no longer interested in
producing adventure games would find profit in distributing ones created by outside teams?</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> That could be true, but I think the future is brighter than
that. I think that sooner or later somebody will design an adventure game that helps
revitalize the genre. Then all the companies that used to do adventures will start doing
them again. The same thing happened with role-playing games. Five years ago, nobody in the
US wanted to make RPGs. Now they're popular again. It works in a cycle, eventually games
that are out of fashion come back into fashion.</font></p>

usenet threads but... if you were left in a deserted island, and you had to choose three
adventure games to accompany you, the winners would be...</p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#800080"><B>J.M.-</B></FONT><FONT FACE=ARIAL SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000"> Yowch, this is tough! I would want to choose games that I
never finished, not games I had already played and loved. So I think I would choose:</font></p>

B. Gabriel Knight 3 (I know it's not out yet!)<br>
C. Suspended</font></p>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=2 COLOR="#000000">And this way, even if my 3-D graphics card overheats, I still
have two games to play!</font></p>

talk to Spanish adventure game players, and I can only hope I get to do an adventure game
soon, hopefully one that's available in Spain!</font></p>
