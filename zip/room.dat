The grass here is tall and dark. The moonlight falls upon the ground like a
raindrop of bright water. To the north, the garden ends abruptaly and it 
falls down about a hundred meters, to the rocks down bellow...

The grass here is becomming scarce, as the rocky ground becomes sterner. The
rock has various tones of red, and it is similar to the rock in the cliffside
to the north. You hear the waves crashing into the rocks bellow, and you feel
a draft of cold wind, making you shiver.

All there is in this part of the garden is earth... Fresh earth, as some great
force had dug up tunnels below your feet. You feel in the air the scent of

Here stands a great pine tree, with a bench below it. In the ground there are
some pines.
You feel that the rain in this side of the mansion is colder and stronger, and
you long for your home, back in Lisbon...

The house's library is full of old and new books, all the walls covered with
bookshelfs. By your feet, there is a red carpet, and above you, on the ceiling
there is a beutifull painting of naked men and women, having a ball...
You feel a draft, and you start to wonder why, since you are in indoors and all
the windows are locked...

This is an old corridor. It has lots of doors, but all of them are stuck or
locked... You can feel the faint smell of gas, and it makes you feel dizzy.
You can hear the sound of metal, like a million chains beeing dragged about
the house.

Here is your uncle's treasure vault ! 
You have found your uncle's legacy, but you are now stuck.
To the east, you see a brick wall, with some old wine bottles full of dust
near it...
The ground is ladden with gold coins, diamonds and other precious artifacts.

The living room has a strange feel to it... You feel unconfortable, perhaps
because you uncle died in such horrible situation, in this same room...
A stain of blood is on the couch.

The hall of Fanglore is magnificent... A great stairway leads up, tough it is
blocked by a piece of the ceiling that has fallen down. You wonder how did your
uncle lived here, all alone and isolated from the world. To the north there is
a corridor, and to the west lies the living room.
You smell a faint scent of gas, and it appears to come from the corridor...

This part of the garden has small pond, with round smooth rocks all around it.
In the middle of the pond, a toad sings, and you stop a little to listen. For
strange as it may seem, you seem to hear a women's voice singing with the
toad, and you try to pinpoint it's origin... This is when the toad jumps in the
water and all becomes silent again...
